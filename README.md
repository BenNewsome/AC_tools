# AC_tools - Atmospheric Chemistry (AC) tools

This repository contains a portable collection of functions used for 
working with global/regional chemical transport model (CTM) ouput and
observations.

The module is setup to be used as a submodule, with collections of
functions held in module files that can be imported in entirely or 
seperately
 
e.g. 

from AC_tools.funcs4time import *

or 

from AC_tools import *

Example analysis code for GEOS-Chem using AC_tools is available here:
